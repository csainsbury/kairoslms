Kairoslms Project Specification

1. Overview

Kairoslms is a life management system designed to help users set and track overarching strategic goals across multiple life domains—ranging from professional advancement and project progression to personal and interpersonal goals. The system ingests data from various sources (emails, calendar events, tasks, and biographical context), processes and synthesizes this information using a reasoning LLM (deepseek R1), and then produces actionable status overviews and prioritized task lists. The user interface is designed to provide a persistent view of high-level goals, granular subtasks, and a chat interface to interact with the system.

2. Functional Requirements

2.1 Data Ingestion
	•	Emails:
	•	Use a dedicated Gmail account configured to receive BCC copies of sent emails.
	•	Ingest and extract only email headers and text content (no attachments or HTML parsing required).
	•	Emails are processed in daily batches.
	•	Calendar:
	•	Integration using the Google Calendar API to read existing commitments and events.
	•	Todoist Tasks:
	•	Use the Todoist API to pull tasks and subtasks.
	•	Allow direct entry of tasks that can be forwarded to Todoist.
	•	Biographical Context:
	•	Provide an editable text document storing the user’s biography (hobbies, children, likes/dislikes, etc.) to be used as contextual information.

2.2 Data Processing & Updates
	•	Status Overviews (12-Hourly):
	•	For each high-level goal (HLG) and project-level goal (PLG), generate or update a ‘status overview’ that includes:
	•	A description of the goal.
	•	A breakdown of proposed subtasks to achieve the goal.
	•	Identification of obstacles with accompanying subtasks to overcome them.
	•	Priority indication for each subtask.
	•	Task Prioritization (Every 30 Minutes or On-Demand):
	•	Pull new tasks from Todoist and newly ingested emails.
	•	Review all new inputs from any source, the current context, and the latest status overviews.
	•	Generate a consolidated ranking of all subtasks based on:
	•	Importance of the parent goal/project.
	•	Imminent deadlines.
	•	Impact on user wellbeing.
	•	Provide the ability for manual override of task priorities via the UI.
	•	Additional Email Analysis (Daily):
	•	Analyze email traffic to:
	•	Identify key correspondents and any new additions.
	•	Detect evolving interpersonal issues or hidden agendas.
	•	Suggest additional subtasks for the master task list as needed.

2.3 Reasoning LLM Integration
	•	Deepseek R1 Integration:
	•	Tightly integrate deepseek R1 within the application logic.
	•	Engage the model as frequently as possible (both during scheduled processing and on-demand) to provide continuous, reasoning-driven guidance.
	•	Optimize the prompt structure specifically for reasoning, ensuring the model considers the full spectrum of goals across all domains simultaneously.

2.4 User Interface (UI)
	•	Dashboard Components:
	•	High-Level Goals & Projects List: Always visible, showing the status of HLGs and PLGs with options for manual priority adjustments.
	•	Granular Subtasks List: Detailed view of individual subtasks linked to each goal.
	•	Chat Interface: A text box for interactive communication with the system.
	•	Model Suggestions: A dedicated area for listing model-generated subthemes, agendas, or tasks that might not be on the user’s radar.
	•	Dynamic Scheduling Configuration:
	•	Provide UI controls to allow users to adjust the frequency of background processes (e.g., status overview updates and task prioritization intervals) as system load or personal preferences change.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Security & Privacy:
	•	Encryption: All sensitive data (emails, calendar events, tasks, biographical context) must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
	•	Access Control: Implement strict access control measures with user authentication (including Google authentication for user accounts).
	•	Backups: Regular backup policies must be established to prevent data loss.
	•	Reliability & Scalability:
	•	The system must be highly reliable in a remote deployment context, with a focus on stable and repeatable environment setup.
	•	System performance should remain robust under varying loads, with the ability to scale as needed.
	•	Maintainability:
	•	Code should be modular with clear separation of concerns (data ingestion, processing, UI, error handling).
	•	Logging and monitoring must be implemented to facilitate debugging and performance tracking.

4. Architectural Decisions & Data Handling

4.1 Data Integration
	•	Email Ingestion:
	•	A dedicated Gmail account will be used. Emails will be fetched and processed in daily batches.
	•	Calendar & Todoist:
	•	Integrate using their respective APIs for real-time data retrieval.
	•	Biographical Data:
	•	Managed as a context document that is stored and updated in the local database.

4.2 Data Storage
	•	Local Database:
	•	A local database (SQL or NoSQL, whichever is easiest to implement) will store:
	•	Contextual documents (biography, project documentation)
	•	Tasks and subtasks
	•	Status overviews
	•	The focus is on ease of editing and consistency, with no preference for SQL vs. NoSQL as long as it meets functional needs.

4.3 Processing Architecture
	•	Batch Processing:
	•	12-Hourly: Generate/update status overviews for HLGs and PLGs.
	•	30-Minute / On-Demand: Prioritize tasks and subtasks based on new inputs.
	•	LLM Invocation:
	•	Deepseek R1 is tightly integrated into the application logic to continuously guide goal achievement, using optimized prompts tailored for reasoning.

4.4 Environment & Deployment
	•	Remote Deployment:
	•	The system will be deployed remotely on a host running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
	•	Containerization:
	•	Use Docker Compose to containerize the application stack.
	•	This ensures consistency across development, staging, and production environments.
	•	Environment setup will include clearly defined base images (Ubuntu-based where necessary) and proper version control for dependencies.
	•	Configuration Management:
	•	Environment variables, secrets, and other configuration details are managed within Docker Compose following standard practices.

5. Error Management Strategies
	•	Automatic Retries:
	•	For failures in data ingestion (e.g., Calendar or Todoist API failures), implement automatic retries with exponential back-off.
	•	Logging:
	•	Detailed logging of errors and events should be maintained to facilitate debugging and system audits.
	•	User Notifications:
	•	When errors occur (after retries have been exhausted), the system should notify the user with clear, actionable messages.
	•	Monitoring:
	•	Implement health checks and monitoring for all services to detect and address issues proactively.

6. Testing Plan

6.1 Unit Testing
	•	Components to Test:
	•	Email ingestion (parsing headers and text content).
	•	API integrations for Google Calendar and Todoist.
	•	Local database interactions (CRUD operations for tasks, context documents, and status overviews).
	•	LLM invocation and prompt formatting for deepseek R1.
	•	Tools & Frameworks:
	•	Use standard testing frameworks (e.g., pytest for Python) to create comprehensive unit tests for each component.

6.2 Integration Testing
	•	End-to-End Flows:
	•	Simulate data ingestion from multiple sources (emails, calendar, Todoist) and verify that the processing pipeline (status overviews, task prioritization) works correctly.
	•	Test UI interactions, including manual override of task priorities and adjustments to scheduling intervals.
	•	Failure Scenarios:
	•	Create test cases for error conditions (e.g., API failures, network outages) to ensure that automatic retries, logging, and user notifications are triggered appropriately.
	•	LLM Integration:
	•	Validate that deepseek R1 processes contextual inputs correctly and returns actionable insights.
	•	Test the system’s behavior under varying prompt structures to ensure robust reasoning.

6.3 Deployment Testing
	•	Container Environment:
	•	Validate that Docker Compose correctly builds and deploys the application stack on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
	•	Test environment consistency across development, staging, and production setups.
	•	Perform stress and reliability tests to confirm that the remote setup is stable and scalable.
