# KairosLMS Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures, access controls, backup policies, and other security-related procedures implemented in the KairosLMS application.

## Data Security

### Encryption at Rest

KairosLMS implements the following measures to protect data at rest:

1. **Database Encryption**:
   - Sensitive fields in the database are encrypted using AES-256 encryption
   - Encryption keys are managed securely and not stored with the data they protect
   - PostgreSQL's column-level encryption is used for particularly sensitive data

2. **Filesystem Security**:
   - Configuration files with secrets are stored with appropriate file permissions
   - Temporary files containing sensitive information are securely deleted after use
   - Logs are sanitized to prevent sensitive data leakage

### Encryption in Transit

1. **HTTPS/TLS**:
   - All API communications use HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ only
   - Strong cipher suites are enforced
   - Certificate management procedures are in place for production deployments

2. **API Security**:
   - API keys and tokens are transmitted securely via headers, never in URLs
   - Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse of API endpoints
   - Request payload size limits are enforced

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication

1. **OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect**:
   - Google Authentication is integrated for secure user login
   - JWT tokens are used for maintaining sessions
   - Tokens have appropriate expiration times (configurable via environment variables)

2. **Password Security** (for direct authentication):
   - Password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate work factors
   - Secure password reset workflow
   - Account lockout after failed login attempts

### Authorization System

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Access to resources is controlled based on user roles
   - Principle of least privilege is followed for all operations
   - Role assignments are logged and auditable

2. **API Permission Controls**:
   - All API endpoints are protected with appropriate permission checks
   - Dependency injection pattern is used for consistent authorization rules
   - All access attempts are logged for audit purposes

## Error Handling & Logging

### Secure Error Handling

1. **Public Error Messages**:
   - Detailed error information is never exposed to end users
   - Generic error messages are returned for security-sensitive operations
   - Error codes provide necessary context without exposing internals

2. **Internal Error Logging**:
   - Detailed error information including stack traces is logged internally
   - Error logs are automatically monitored for security-relevant events
   - Error aggregation and alerting is configured for critical issues

### Logging Practices

1. **Log Security**:
   - Logs are stored securely with appropriate access controls
   - No sensitive data (passwords, tokens, etc.) is logged
   - Log rotation and retention policies limit exposure

2. **Audit Logging**:
   - All authentication attempts (successful and failed) are logged
   - Administrative actions are logged with user identity
   - Data access/modification events are logged for sensitive operations

## Backup & Recovery

### Backup Policies

1. **Database Backups**:
   - Full database backups are performed daily
   - Point-in-time recovery is enabled via WAL archiving
   - Backups are encrypted with a separate key from application data

2. **Configuration Backups**:
   - Application configurations are backed up after any changes
   - Version control is used for tracking configuration changes
   - Backup automation is implemented via the scheduling system

### Retention & Restoration

1. **Backup Retention**:
   - Daily backups are retained for 30 days (configurable)
   - Weekly backups are retained for 3 months
   - Monthly backups are retained for 1 year

2. **Recovery Procedures**:
   - Documented procedures for database restoration
   - Regular recovery testing to validate backup integrity
   - Recovery time objectives (RTO) defined and measured

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Security

1. **Dependency Scanning**:
   - Regular scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities
   - Automated updates for non-breaking security patches
   - Critical vulnerabilities trigger immediate notification

2. **Code Security**:
   - Input validation on all user-provided data
   - Output encoding to prevent XSS attacks
   - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### Security Testing

1. **Automated Security Testing**:
   - Security-focused unit and integration tests
   - Automated scanning for common security issues
   - Protocol-level security validation

## Incident Response

### Monitoring & Detection

1. **Security Monitoring**:
   - Failed authentication attempts are monitored
   - Unusual access patterns trigger alerts
   - System resource usage is monitored for anomalies

2. **Alerting**:
   - Critical security events trigger immediate notifications
   - Escalation procedures are defined for different severity levels
   - Contact information is kept current for security team members

### Response Procedures

1. **Incident Classification**:
   - Security events are classified by severity and impact
   - Response procedures are defined for each classification
   - Documentation requirements for security incidents

2. **Containment & Recovery**:
   - Procedures for isolating compromised components
   - Steps for analyzing the scope of an incident
   - Guidelines for system recovery after security incidents

## Compliance & Documentation

1. **Security Documentation**:
   - Regular updates to security documentation
   - Security design principles are documented
   - Security-related configuration options are documented

2. **Access Review**:
   - Regular review of user access rights
   - Procedure for removing access when no longer needed
   - Audit of privileged account usage

3. **Compliance Checks**:
   - Regular self-assessment against security requirements
   - Documentation of compliance status
   - Remediation planning for identified gaps

## Environment Security

1. **Container Security**:
   - Minimal base images to reduce attack surface
   - Non-root user execution where possible
   - Resource limitations to prevent DoS attacks

2. **Network Security**:
   - Services only expose necessary ports
   - Network segmentation between components
   - Internal service communication uses authentication

This documentation should be reviewed and updated regularly as the security landscape evolves and as application features change.
